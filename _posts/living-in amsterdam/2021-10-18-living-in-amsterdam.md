Likewise each person, I had a dream places to work and live. In aspect,  Amsterdam was one of the top 3 places to live before died. Moreover, I've visited the city 3 years ago as an ordinary tourist. Who could claim that I will move to Netherlands on those days. I've got a job offer and started to work as a software engineer one of the top notch consulting company in europe.  I would like to appreciate them for the smooth relocation period.

In this post, I would like to give some recommendations to expats that has a job offer and relocating to Netherlands. 


I've divided topics into 3 pillars:   
* Overview of recruitment process.
* Daily life challenges in Netherlands.
* Paperworks for Turkish citizens. Applying for HSM and %30 tax rulling.
